      <h1>Privacy Policy - True Profit</h1>

      <h2>ABOUT</h2>
      <p>
        True Profit helps Shopify merchants understand whether they are actually
        making money - and where they might be leaking profit. It shows
        estimated total profit across recent orders, lets merchants set global
        Cost of Goods and payment fees, displays per-order profit (read-only on
        Free), unlocks advanced controls and detailed insights on Pro
      </p>

      <p>
        True Profit is a Shopify application developed under the Importantly
        initiative. This privacy policy explains how data is collected, used,
        and protected when merchants install and use the app.
      </p>

      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <p>
        True Profit only accesses data necessary to provide its core
        functionality. This may include store information, order data, and
        financial metrics required to calculate profitability.
      </p>

      <h2>How we use data</h2>
      <p>
        Data is used solely to deliver features within the app. We do not sell,
        share, or use merchant data for advertising or unrelated purposes.
      </p>

      <h2>Data retention</h2>
      <p>
        True Profit does not store customer personal data outside Shopify unless
        required for app functionality. Any locally stored configuration data is
        used only to display profit-related insights inside Shopify Admin.
      </p>
